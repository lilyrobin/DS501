#code for problem 3
#default color is blue for men, colorful points stand for women so that it can better see the distribution
#of those points between men and women. 

#scatter plot of men vs women, their mean rating for every movie
# with the increase of men's mean rating of movies, the mean rating of women is also increased. According to
#the scatter plot, we can argue that there is a linear corelation between men's rating and women's rating.

#men vs women average rating, ratings count>200
#we can see in the scatter plot that men's average rating which is over 200 times is definitely linearly associated with
#women's average rating.

#correlation cofficient between men and women is 0.76319
#correlation cofficient r, its range from -1 to 1, if abs(r) is larger or near 1, the degree of linear correlation
#is higher. so our correlation cofficient r=0.76319 which is larger than 1, it can prove this is a positive linear 
#correlation between that two datasets. Meanwhile 0.5<|r|<0.8, we can say they are moderate corelation.

#Q:Are men and women more similar when they are younger or older
#Analysis:firstly, we have to mention correlation coefficient r. The bigger r is, the degree of correlation is higher
which means in this situation people tend to do similar thing like similar rating. Unfortunately, what had happened
is not what we expected. r is totally different among different group of people. you can see the correlation coeffienct r that is collected
by us, as age of people increased, from children to middle aged people, r has been increased constantly. To sum up , there exist a tendancy 
that people rate similarly with the increase of their age.


#idea two: 

#more exploration of men vs women
#would be hardest to predict for movies with the greatest difference between them
#so what has the greatest difference between them?
