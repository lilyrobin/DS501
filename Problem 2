#* Make some conjectures about the distribution of ratings? Support your answers with data!  
#*  For example, what age range do you think has more extreme ratings?  Do you think children are more or less likely to rate a movie 1 or 5?
#*  Be sure to come up with your own conjectures and support them with data!

#by age
#conjecture: ratings stabalize as groups age. Movies are so gender oriented for kids (princesses vs gi joe types) but as they age, 
#movies are made the please the whole audience. yes there are still action films vs chick flicks, but in general, the movies 
#the everyone sees, like big dramas, are meant to appeal to everyone. So we'd expect less variance as the age groups get older



#age group-more variance in kids, standard deviation gets smaller as older
