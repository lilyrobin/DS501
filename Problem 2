#tails go away, we would trust these ratings more (bigger sample size)

#* Make some conjectures about the distribution of ratings? Support your answers with data!  
#*  For example, what age range do you think has more extreme ratings?  Do you think children are more or less likely to rate a movie 1 or 5?
#*  Be sure to come up with your own conjectures and support them with data!
